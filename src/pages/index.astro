				<h2 slot="review-title" class="leading-6">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
  				in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
				</h2>
				<p slot="review-main">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
  				transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  				for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  				The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  				the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

				<h2 slot="review-title">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the
   				bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their
    			experiences was easy.</h2>
				<p slot="review-main">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
					which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
					to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
					developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
					attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

				<h2 slot="review-title">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
				<p slot="review-main">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
					code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
					programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
					theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
					curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
					had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
					outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
					could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
					example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
					full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
