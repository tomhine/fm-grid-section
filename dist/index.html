      <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
					code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
					programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
					theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
					curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
					had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
					outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
					could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
					example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
					full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
