- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-First CSS Framework
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static Site Builder

### What I learned

This was my first time using the Astro Framework. I've really enjoyed it, definitely going to keep on using it for any static sites. I love writing html, css and javascript in a really fundamental way, but also being able to use components and scoped styling etc.
